Some notes on config for Express.js

1) use command npm init in the root of the directory you want to initialize Express in
2) you'll be prompted to change set up - only change the entry point: to app.js (app.js will be your 'server' file)
3) run command npm install express - this should install a load of node modules.
4) create a .gitignore file and write /node_modules
5) adjust folder structure to match this best practice - http://www.terlici.com/2014/08/25/best-practices-express-structure.html
6) add an app.js file in the root - look at the app.js in this folder for set up
7) adjust script links accordingly (nb - express knows to look for scripts and css in the public folder)
8) in package.json, within the "scripts" tag, add "start" : "node app.js"
9) in the command line, run npm start or node app.js
